# Eskom-EXPO-Project-2018
Source code for my 2018 Eskom EXPO project

This repository contains all the code I wrote for my 2018 Eskom EXPO project where I entered into the computer science category.
The code is written in c# and makes use of the MonoBrick NXT library in order to communicate with the printer.
